In Lifty, the programmer specifies a policy by\\nannotating the source of sensitive data with a refinement type, and the system\\nautomatically inserts access checks necessary to enforce this policy across the\\ncode. This is a significant improvement over current practice, where\\nprogrammers manually implement access checks, and any missing check can cause\\nan information leak. To support this programming model, we have developed (1)\\nan encoding of information flow security in terms of decidable refinement types\\nthat enables fully automatic verification and (2) a program repair algorithm\\nthat localizes unsafe accesses to sensitive data and replaces them with\\nprovably secure alternatives. We formalize the encoding and prove its\\nnoninterference guarantee. Our experience using Lifty to implement a conference\\nmanagement system shows that it decreases policy burden and is able to\\nefficiently synthesize all necessary access checks, including those required to\\nprevent a set of reported real-world information leaks.\\n',\n",

We present a simple transaction\\nmodel for streams that integrates seamlessly with a traditional OLTP system.

By implementing S-Store in this way, we can\\nmake use of the transaction processing facilities that H-Store already\\nsupports, and we can concentrate on the additional implementation features that\\nare needed to support streaming. Similar implementations could be done using\\nother main-memory OLTP platforms. We show that we can actually achieve higher\\nthroughput for streaming workloads in S-Store than an equivalent deployment in\\nH-Store alone. We also show how this can be achieved within H-Store with the\\naddition of a modest amount of new functionality. Furthermore, we compare\\nS-Store to two state-of-the-art streaming systems, Spark Streaming and Storm,\\nand show how S-Store matches and sometimes exceeds their performance while\\nproviding stronger transactional guarantees.\\n',\n",

New\\nmeasurement methods can measure concentrations for all molecular species in a\\npathway, which creates a new opportunity to decompose the optimization of rate\\nparameters. Results: In contrast with conventional methods that minimize the\\ndisagreement between simulated and observed concentrations, the BPPE method\\nfits a spline curve through the observed concentration points, and then matches\\nthe derivatives of the spline-curve to the production and consumption of each\\nspecies. Whereas traditional methods follow the ODEs exactly and then attempt\\nto match the data, BPPE follows the data exactly and then attempts to match the\\nODEs.

Although this\\ntechnique has been successfully employed in a variety of physical systems,\\nincluding natural and artificial atoms and molecules, its application is not\\nuniversally straightforward, and becomes extremely challenging for frequencies\\nin the range of 10's and 100's of gigahertz. Here we demonstrate an alternative\\napproach, whereby a harmonic driving field sweeps the atom through its\\nenergy-level avoided crossings at a fixed frequency, surmounting many of the\\nlimitations of the conventional approach. Spectroscopic information is obtained\\nfrom the amplitude dependence of the system response. The resulting\\n``spectroscopy diamonds'' contain interference patterns and population\\ninversion that serve as a fingerprint of the atom's spectrum. By analyzing\\nthese features, we determine the energy spectrum of a manifold of states with\\nenergies from 0.01 to 120 GHz \\\\times h in a superconducting artificial atom,\\nusing a driving frequency near 0.1 GHz.

This\\nalgorithm is based on finding the causal ordering of the variables that yields\\nthe sparsest DAG. We prove that this new score-based method is consistent under\\nstrictly weaker conditions than the faithfulness assumption. We also\\ndemonstrate through simulations on small DAGs that the SP algorithm compares\\nfavorably to the constraint-based PC and SGS algorithms as well as the\\nscore-based Greedy Equivalence Search and hybrid Max-Min Hill-Climbing method.\\nIn the Gaussian setting, we prove that our algorithm boils down to finding the\\npermutation of the variables with sparsest Cholesky decomposition for the\\ninverse covariance matrix. Using this connection, we show that in the oracle\\nsetting, where the true covariance matrix is known, the SP algorithm is in fact\\nequivalent to $\\\\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimation.\\n',\n",

Compared to other\\nmetrics which require exact matchings between elements, this metric uses a\\nsimilarity function to compare elements between the two sets, making it robust\\nto small dissimilarities in elements and more useful for real-world, dirty\\ndata. Unfortunately, the metric suffers from expensive computational cost,\\ntaking O(n^3) time, where n is the number of elements in sets, for each\\nset-to-set comparison. Thus for applications which try to search for all\\npairings of related sets in a brute-force manner, the runtime becomes\\nunacceptably large.\\nTo address this challenge, we developed SilkMoth, a system capable of rapidly\\ndiscovering related set pairs in collections of sets. Internally, SilkMoth\\ncreates a signature for each set, with the property that any other set which is\\nrelated must match the signature. SilkMoth then uses these signatures to prune\\nthe search space, so only sets which match the signatures are left as\\ncandidates. Finally, SilkMoth applies the maximum matching metric on remaining\\ncandidates to verify which of these candidates are truly related sets. Thus, a\\ncontribution of this paper is the characterization of the space of signatures\\nwhich enable this property.

In this paper we establish the expressive\\npower of spatial conjunction. We construct an embedding from first-order logic\\nwith spatial conjunction into second-order logic, and more surprisingly, an\\nembedding from full second order logic into first-order logic with spatial\\nconjunction. These embeddings show that the satisfiability of formulas in\\nfirst-order logic with spatial conjunction is equivalent to the satisfiability\\nof formulas in second-order logic. These results explain the great expressive\\npower of spatial conjunction and can be used to show that adding unrestricted\\nspatial conjunction to a decidable logic leads to an undecidable logic. As one\\nexample, we show that adding unrestricted spatial conjunction to two-variable\\nlogic leads to undecidability. On the side of decidability, the embedding into\\nsecond-order logic immediately implies the decidability of first-order logic\\nwith a form of spatial conjunction over trees. The embedding into spatial\\nconjunction also has useful consequences: because a restricted form of spatial\\nconjunction in two-variable logic preserves decidability, we obtain that a\\ncorrespondingly restricted form of second-order quantification in two-variable\\nlogic is decidable.

These annotations are\\nrepresentative of the underlying semantic properties; however, unlike expert\\nannotations, they are noisy: lay authors may use different labels to denote the\\nsame property, and some labels may be missing.

       " '\\nIn Bayesian analysis, the posterior follows from the data and a choice of a\\nprior and a likelihood. One hopes that the posterior is robust to reasonable\\nvariation in the choice of prior and likelihood, since this choice is made by\\nthe modeler and is necessarily somewhat subjective. Despite the fundamental\\nimportance of the problem and a considerable body of literature, the tools of\\nrobust Bayes are not commonly used in practice. This is in large part due to\\nthe difficulty of calculating robustness measures from MCMC draws. Although\\nmethods for computing robustness measures from MCMC draws exist, they lack\\ngenerality and often require additional coding or computation.\\nIn contrast to MCMC, variational Bayes (VB) techniques are readily amenable\\nto robustness analysis. The derivative of a posterior expectation with respect\\nto a prior or data perturbation is a measure of local robustness to the prior\\nor likelihood. Because VB casts posterior inference as an optimization problem,\\nits methodology is built on the ability to calculate derivatives of posterior\\nquantities with respect to model parameters, even in very complex models. In\\nthe present work, we develop local prior robustness measures for mean-field\\nvariational Bayes(MFVB), a VB technique which imposes a particular\\nfactorization assumption on the variational posterior approximation. We start\\nby outlining existing local prior measures of robustness. Next, we use these\\nresults to derive closed-form measures of the sensitivity of mean-field\\nvariational posterior approximation to prior specification. We demonstrate our\\nmethod on a meta-analysis of randomized controlled interventions in access to\\nmicrocredit in developing countries.\\n',\n",

Upon completion of repair, the node re-enters active state, and\\nresumes participation in ongoing and future read, write, and repair operations.\\nTo guarantee liveness and atomicity simultaneously, existing works assume\\neither the presence of nodes with stable storage, or presence of nodes that\\nnever crash during the execution. We demand neither of these; instead we\\nconsider a natural, yet practical network stability condition $N1$ that only\\nrestricts the number of nodes in the crashed/repair state during broadcast of\\nany message.\\nWe present an erasure-code based algorithm $RADON_C$ that is always live, and\\nguarantees atomicity as long as condition $N1$ holds. In situations when the\\nnumber of concurrent writes is limited, $RADON_C$ has significantly improved\\nstorage and communication cost over a replication-based algorithm $RADON_R$,\\nwhich also works under $N1$. We further show how a slightly stronger network\\nstability condition $N2$ can be used to construct algorithms that never violate\\natomicity. The guarantee of atomicity comes at the expense of having an\\nadditional phase during the read and write operations.\\n',\n",

As a result, the time difference between\\narrivals of the signals at the two ends of the nanowire naturally encoded the\\nposition and time of absorption of the photon. Thus, with only two readout\\nlines, we demonstrated that a 19.7-mm-long nanowire meandered across an area of\\n286 {\\\\mu}m * 193 {\\\\mu}m was capable of resolving ~590 effective pixels while\\nsimultaneously recording the arrival times of photons with a temporal\\nresolution of 50 ps.

Since the two sets of two-level\\nsystems are coupled indirectly through the oscillator, excitation transfer from\\none set of two-level systems to the other is possible. In addition, the\\nexcitation energy from the two-level systems may be exchanged with the\\noscillator coherently, even though the oscillator energy may be orders of\\nmagnitude smaller than the two-level system transition energy. In the lossless\\ncase, we demonstrate these effects numerically, and also use an approximate\\ndiagonalization to show that these effects are expected from the model\\nHamiltonian.\\nWe augment the model to include loss effects, and show that loss enhances the\\nexcitation transfer effect by breaking the severe cancelation between different\\npaths that occurs in the lossless case. We describe a simple approximate model\\nwavefunction appropriate when the loss increases rapidly with energy. Within\\nthis model approximation, we present numerical and analytical results for\\nexcitation transfer and energy transfer rates, showing that they are greatly\\nincreased.\\nOur study of these models is motivated in part by claims of excess heat\\nproduction in electrochemical experiments in heavy water.

We study convergence of three\\ncommonly studied classes of adaptive dynamics: discrete-time better/best\\nresponse, logit response, and discrete-time fictitious play dynamics. For\\nbetter/best response dynamics, we focus on the evolution of the sequence of\\npure strategy profiles and show that this sequence converges to a (pure)\\napproximate equilibrium set, whose size is a function of the \"distance\" from a\\nclose potential game.

Thus, our results suggest that games that are close to a\\npotential game inherit the dynamical properties of potential games.

To this end, out-of-sample extensions are\\napplied by constructing an interpolation function that maps from the input\\nspace to the low-dimensional manifold. Commonly used approaches such as the\\nNystr\\\\\"{o}m extension and kernel ridge regression require using all training\\npoints. We propose an interpolation function that only depends on a small\\nsubset of the input training data. Consequently, in the testing phase each new\\npoint only needs to be compared against a small number of input training data\\nin order to project the point onto the low-dimensional space. We interpret our\\nmethod as an out-of-sample extension that approximates kernel ridge regression.\\nOur method involves solving a simple convex optimization problem and has the\\nattractive property of guaranteeing an upper bound on the approximation error,\\nwhich is crucial for medical applications. Tuning this error bound controls the\\nsparsity of the resulting interpolation function. We illustrate our method in\\ntwo clinical applications that require fast mapping of input images onto a\\nlow-dimensional space.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nSeveral significant models have been developed that enable the study of\\ndiffusion of signals across biological, social and engineered networks. Within\\nthese established frameworks, the inverse problem of identifying the source of\\nthe propagated signal is challenging, owing to the numerous alternative\\npossibilities for signal progression through the network. In real world\\nnetworks, the challenge of determining sources is compounded as the true\\npropagation dynamics are typically unknown, and when they have been directly\\nmeasured, they rarely conform to the assumptions of any of the well-studied\\nmodels. In this paper we introduce a method called Network Infusion (NI) that\\nhas been designed to circumvent these issues, making source inference practical\\nfor large, complex real world networks. The key idea is that to infer the\\nsource node in the network, full characterization of diffusion dynamics, in\\nmany cases, may not be necessary. This objective is achieved by creating a\\ndiffusion kernel that well-approximates standard diffusion models, but lends\\nitself to inversion, by design, via likelihood maximization or error\\nminimization. We apply NI for both single-source and multi-source diffusion,\\nfor both single-snapshot and multi-snapshot observations, and for both\\nhomogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion setups. We prove the mean-field\\noptimality of NI for different scenarios, and demonstrate its effectiveness\\nover several synthetic networks. Moreover, we apply NI to a real-data\\napplication, identifying news sources in the Digg social network, and\\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of NI compared to existing methods. Finally, we\\npropose an integrative source inference framework that combines NI with a\\ndistance centrality-based method, which leads to a robust performance in cases\\nwhere the underlying dynamics are unknown.\\n',\n",

Various\\nchannel-dependent improvements (called strong data-processing inequalities, or\\nSDPIs) of this inequality have been proposed both classically and more\\nrecently. In this note we first survey known results relating various notions\\nof contraction for a single channel. Then we consider the basic extension:\\ngiven SDPI for each constituent channel in a Bayesian network, how to produce\\nan end-to-end SDPI?\\nOur approach is based on the (extract of the) Evans-Schulman method, which is\\ndemonstrated for three different kinds of SDPIs, namely, the usual\\nAhslwede-G\\\\\\'acs type contraction coefficients (mutual information), Dobrushin\\'s\\ncontraction coefficients (total variation), and finally the $F_I$-curve (the\\nbest possible non-linear SDPI for a given channel). Resulting bounds on the\\ncontraction coefficients are interpreted as probability of site percolation. As\\nan example, we demonstrate how to obtain SDPI for an $n$-letter memoryless\\nchannel with feedback given an SDPI for $n=1$.\\nFinally, we discuss a simple observation on the equivalence of a linear SDPI\\nand comparison to an erasure channel (in the sense of \"less noisy\" order). This\\nleads to a simple proof of a curious inequality of Samorodnitsky (2015), and\\nsheds light on how information spreads in the subsets of inputs of a memoryless\\nchannel.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIn this paper, we propose a new lower approximation scheme for POMDP with\\ndiscounted and average cost criterion. The approximating functions are\\ndetermined by their values at a finite number of belief points, and can be\\ncomputed efficiently using value iteration algorithms for finite-state MDP.\\nWhile for discounted problems several lower approximation schemes have been\\nproposed earlier, ours seems the first of its kind for average cost problems.\\nWe focus primarily on the average cost case, and we show that the corresponding\\napproximation can be computed efficiently using multi-chain algorithms for\\nfinite-state MDP. We give a preliminary analysis showing that regardless of the\\nexistence of the optimal average cost J in the POMDP, the approximation\\nobtained is a lower bound of the liminf optimal average cost function, and can\\nalso be used to calculate an upper bound on the limsup optimal average cost\\nfunction, as well as bounds on the cost of executing the stationary policy\\nassociated with the approximation.

       " '\\nNeutron resonance spectrometry (NRS) has been used to measure the temperature\\ninside Mo samples during shock loading. The temperatures obtained were\\nsignificantly higher than predicted assuming ideal hydrodynamic loading. The\\neffect of plastic flow and non-ideal projectile behavior were assessed. Plastic\\nflow was calculated self-consistently with the shock jump conditions: this is\\nnecessary for a rigorous estimate of the locus of shock states accessible.\\nPlastic flow was estimated to contribute a temperature rise of 53K compared\\nwith hydrodynamic flow. Simulations were performed of the operation of the\\nexplosively-driven projectile system used to induce the shock in the Mo sample.\\nThe simulations predicted that the projectile was significantly curved on\\nimpact, and still accelerating. The resulting spatial variations in load,\\nincluding radial components of velocity, were predicted to increase the\\napparent temperature that would be deduced from the width of the neutron\\nresonance by 160K. These corrections are sufficient to reconcile the apparent\\ntemperatures deduced using NRS with the accepted properties of Mo, in\\nparticular its equation of state.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nExisting models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for sentence\\nclassification often do not incorporate the context in which sentences appear,\\nand classify sentences individually. However, traditional sentence\\nclassification approaches have been shown to greatly benefit from jointly\\nclassifying subsequent sentences, such as with conditional random fields. In\\nthis work, we present an ANN architecture that combines the effectiveness of\\ntypical ANN models to classify sentences in isolation, with the strength of\\nstructured prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two\\ndifferent datasets for sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nMotivated by applications to distributed optimization over networks and\\nlarge-scale data processing in machine learning, we analyze the deterministic\\nincremental aggregated gradient method for minimizing a finite sum of smooth\\nfunctions where the sum is strongly convex. This method processes the functions\\none at a time in a deterministic order and incorporates a memory of previous\\ngradient values to accelerate convergence. Empirically it performs well in\\npractice; however, no theoretical analysis with explicit rate results was\\npreviously given in the literature to our knowledge, in particular most of the\\nrecent efforts concentrated on the randomized versions. In this paper, we show\\nthat this deterministic algorithm has global linear convergence and\\ncharacterize the convergence rate. We also consider an aggregated method with\\nmomentum and demonstrate its linear convergence. Our proofs rely on a careful\\nchoice of a Lyapunov function that offers insight into the algorithm's behavior\\nand simplifies the proofs considerably.\\n\",\n",
