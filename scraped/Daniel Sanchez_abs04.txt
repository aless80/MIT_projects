Abstract: Symmetry places strong constraints on the electronic features of crystals. By
considering the role of time-reversal, $\mathcal{T}$, symmetry in structurally
chiral crystals with significant spin-orbit interaction, we show that Kramers
theorem may lead to the realization of topologically robust Weyl fermionic
excitations \textit{pinned} to the time-reversal-invariant crystal momenta. By
constructing a tight-binding model for $\mathcal{T}$-invariant chiral crystals
in space group 16 (SG-16), we demonstrate the conditions under which Kramers
theorem-enforced Weyl fermions are universal features. We identify their unique
topological properties and use density functional theory to predict that
Ag$_3$BO$_3$ (SG-156), TlTe$_2$O$_6$ (SG-150), and Ag$_2$Se (SG-19) are
examples of Kramers theorem-enforced Weyl metals. Our results demonstrate a
methodology that can be utilized for identifying novel gapless topological
states in real materials [Ag3BO3 (SG-156 class), TlTe2O6 (SG-150 class), and
Ag2Se (SG-19 class) families of compounds].
