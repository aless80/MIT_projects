We present new formulae for the matrix elements of one-body and two-body
physical operators in compact forms, which are applicable to arbitrary
Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov wave functions, including those for multi-quasiparticle
excitations. The test calculations show that our formulae may substantially
accelerate the process of symmetry restoration when applied to the heavy
nuclear system.
