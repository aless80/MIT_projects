We propose an on-chip scalable cluster-state quantum computing (QC)
architecture comprising a two-dimensional array of atomic qubits and detectors,
networked by photonic switches and waveguides. A major barrier to scaling up
such systems lies in efficiently entangling neighboring atomic memories by
conversion of the qubits to photons and establishing entanglement via Bell
measurements in the optical domain, all within the coherence time. Our
architecture leverages percolation theory to significantly reduce the time
required to create a universal-QC-capable cluster of atomic memories, compared
with recently-studied architectures that rely on repeat-until-success
entanglement connections. This reduction puts our architecture in an
operational regime where demonstrated collection, coupling and detection
efficiencies would be sufficient for scalable QC with experimentally
demonstrated coherence times. Furthermore, our approach dispenses the need for
time consuming feed-forward, high-cooperativity interfaces and ancilla single
photons, and can also tolerate a high rate of site imperfections. We also
propose a variant of the architecture which allows for long-range connections
and makes our architecture even more resilient to low site yields. We analyze
our architecture for nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, but emphasize
that the approach applies to any atomic or atom-like system.
