We present a novel hybrid system where an optical cavity is integrated with a
microfabricated planar-electrode ion trap. The trap electrodes produce a
tunable periodic potential allowing the trapping of up to 50 separate ion
chains spaced by 160 $\mu$m along the cavity axis. Each chain can contain up to
20 individually addressable Yb\textsuperscript{+} ions coupled to the cavity
mode. We demonstrate deterministic distribution of ions between the sites of
the electrostatic periodic potential and control of the ion-cavity coupling.
The measured strength of this coupling should allow access to the strong
collective coupling regime with $\lesssim$10 ions. The optical cavity could
serve as a quantum information bus between ions or be used to generate a strong
wavelength-scale periodic optical potential.
