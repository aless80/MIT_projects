We report on vertically-illuminated photodiodes fabricated in the
GlobalFoundries 45nm 12SOI node and on a packaging concept for
optically-interconnected chips. The photodiodes are responsive at 1180 nm, a
wavelength currently used in chip-to-chip communications. They have further a
wide field-of-view which enables chip-to-board positional feedback in
chip-board assemblies. Monolithic integration enables on-chip processing of the
positional data.
