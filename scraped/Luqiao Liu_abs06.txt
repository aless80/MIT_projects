A pure spin current generated within a nonlocal spin valve can exert a spin
transfer torque on a nanomagnet. This nonlocal torque enables new design
schemes for magnetic memory devices that do not require the application of
large voltages across tunnel barriers that can suffer electrical breakdown.
Here we report a quantitative measurement of this nonlocal spin torque using
spin-torque-driven ferromagnetic resonance. Our measurement agrees well with
the prediction of an effective circuit model for spin transport. Based on this
model, we suggest strategies for optimizing the strength of nonlocal torque.
