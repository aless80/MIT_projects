Traditional image and video compression algorithms rely on hand-crafted
encoder/decoder pairs (codecs) that lack adaptability and are agnostic to the
data being compressed. Here we describe the concept of generative compression,
the compression of data using generative models, and suggest that it is a
direction worth pursuing to produce more accurate and visually pleasing
reconstructions at much deeper compression levels for both image and video
data. We also demonstrate that generative compression is orders-of-magnitude
more resilient to bit error rates (e.g. from noisy wireless channels) than
traditional variable-length coding schemes.
