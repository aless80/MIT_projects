Consider a linear space of functions on the binary hypercube and a linear
operator $T_\delta$ acting by averaging a function over a Hamming sphere of
radius $\delta n$. It is shown that such an operator has a dimension
independent bound on the norm $L_p \to L_2$ with $p = 1+(1-2\delta)^2$. This
result evidently parallels a classical estimate of Bonami and Gross for $L_p
\to L_q$ norms for the operator of convolution with a Bernoulli noise. The
estimate for $T_\delta$ is harder to obtain since the latter is neither a part
of a semigroup, nor a tensor power. The result is shown by a detailed study of
the eigenvalues of $T_\delta$ and $L_p\to L_2$ norms of the Fourier multiplier
operators $\Pi_a$ with symbol equal to a characterstic function of the Hamming
sphere of radius $a$.
An application of the result to additive combinatorics is given: Any set
$A\subset \FF_2^n$ with the property that $A+A$ contains a large portion of
some Hamming sphere (counted with multiplicity) must have cardinality a
constant multiple of $2^n$. It is also demonstrated that this result does not
follow from standard spectral gap and semi-definite (Lov\'asz-Delsarte)
methods.
