It is our view that the state of the art in constructing a large collection
of graph algorithms in terms of linear algebraic operations is mature enough to
support the emergence of a standard set of primitive building blocks. This
paper is a position paper defining the problem and announcing our intention to
launch an open effort to define this standard.
