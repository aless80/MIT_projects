We show that it is possible for graphene-based Josephson junctions (gJjs) to
detect single photons in a wide electromagnetic spectrum from visible to radio
frequencies. Our approach takes advantage of the exceptionally low electronic
heat capacity of monolayer graphene and its constricted thermal conductance to
its phonon degrees of freedom. Such a system could provide high sensitivity
photon detection required for research areas including quantum information
processing and radio-astronomy. As an example, we present our device concepts
for gJj single photon detectors in both the microwave and infrared regimes. The
dark count rate and intrinsic quantum efficiency are computed based on
parameters from a measured gJj, demonstrating feasibility within existing
technologies.
