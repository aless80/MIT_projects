We present BubbleView, a methodology to replace eye-tracking with mouse
clicks. Participants are presented with a series of blurred images and click to
reveal "bubbles" - small, circular areas of the image at original resolution,
similar to having a confined area of focus like the eye fovea. We evaluated
BubbleView on a variety of image types: information visualizations, natural
images, static webpages, and graphic designs, and compared the clicks to eye
fixations collected with eye-trackers in controlled lab settings. We found that
BubbleView can be used to successfully approximate eye fixations on different
images, and that the regions where people click using BubbleView can also be
used to rank image and design elements by importance. BubbleView is designed to
measure which information people consciously choose to examine, and works best
for defined tasks such as describing the content of an information
visualization or measuring image importance. Compared to related methodologies
based on a moving-window approach, BubbleView provides more reliable and less
noisy data.
