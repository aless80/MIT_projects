This paper presents a programmable, energy-efficient and real-time object
detection accelerator using deformable parts models (DPM), with 2x higher
accuracy than traditional rigid body models. With 8 deformable parts detection,
three methods are used to address the high computational complexity:
classification pruning for 33x fewer parts classification, vector quantization
for 15x memory size reduction, and feature basis projection for 2x reduction of
the cost of each classification. The chip is implemented in 65nm CMOS
technology, and can process HD (1920x1080) images at 30fps without any off-chip
storage while consuming only 58.6mW (0.94nJ/pixel, 1168 GOPS/W). The chip has
two classification engines to simultaneously detect two different classes of
objects. With a tested high throughput of 60fps, the classification engines can
be time multiplexed to detect even more than two object classes. It is energy
scalable by changing the pruning factor or disabling the parts classification.
