Sketch-based synthesis, epitomized by the SKETCH tool, lets developers
synthesize software starting from a partial program, also called a sketch or
template. This paper presents JSKETCH, a tool that brings sketch-based
synthesis to Java. JSKETCH's input is a partial Java program that may include
holes, which are unknown constants, expression generators, which range over
sets of expressions, and class generators, which are partial classes. JSKETCH
then translates the synthesis problem into a SKETCH problem; this translation
is complex because SKETCH is not object-oriented. Finally, JSKETCH synthesizes
an executable Java program by interpreting the output of SKETCH.
