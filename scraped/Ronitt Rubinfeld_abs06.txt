We present simple, self-contained proofs of correctness for algorithms for
linearity testing and program checking of linear functions on finite subsets of
integers represented as n-bit numbers. In addition we explore a generalization
of self-testing to homomorphisms on a multidimensional vector space. We show
that our self-testing algorithm for the univariate case can be directly
generalized to vector space domains. The number of queries made by our
algorithms is independent of domain size.
