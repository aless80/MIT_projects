This paper presents DiffSum, a simple post-election risk-limiting
ballot-polling audit for two-candidate plurality elections. DiffSum
sequentially draws ballots (without replacement) until the numbers $a$, $b$, of
votes for candidates $A$, $B$ satisfies $a>b$ and $(a-b)^2 > c(a+b)$, where $A$
is the reported winner and $c$ is a suitably chosen constant. Bounds on the
error rate (chance of approving an incorrect election outcome) are obtained via
simulations. The method is compared with the Bravo method of Lindeman, Stark,
and Yates.
