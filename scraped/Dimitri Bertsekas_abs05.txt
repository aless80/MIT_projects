We survey incremental methods for minimizing a sum $\sum_{i=1}^mf_i(x)$
consisting of a large number of convex component functions $f_i$. Our methods
consist of iterations applied to single components, and have proved very
effective in practice. We introduce a unified algorithmic framework for a
variety of such methods, some involving gradient and subgradient iterations,
which are known, and some involving combinations of subgradient and proximal
methods, which are new and offer greater flexibility in exploiting the special
structure of $f_i$. We provide an analysis of the convergence and rate of
convergence properties of these methods, including the advantages offered by
randomization in the selection of components. We also survey applications in
inference/machine learning, signal processing, and large-scale and distributed
optimization.
