We present experimental measurements of the electronic contribution to the
Raman spectra of individual metallic single-walled carbon nanotubes (MSWNTs).
Photoexcited carriers are inelastically scattered by a continuum of low-energy
electron-hole pairs created across the graphenelike linear electronic subbands
of the MSWNTs. The optical resonances in MSWNTs give rise to well-defined
electronic Raman peaks. This resonant electronic Raman scattering is a unique
feature of the electronic structure of these one-dimensional quasimetals.
