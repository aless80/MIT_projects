Abell 2146 consists of two galaxy clusters that have recently collided close
to the plane of the sky, and it is unique in showing two large shocks on
$\textit{Chandra X-ray Observatory}$ images. With an early stage merger,
shortly after first core passage, one would expect the cluster galaxies and the
dark matter to be leading the X-ray emitting plasma. In this regard, the
cluster Abell 2146-A is very unusual in that the X-ray cool core appears to
lead, rather than lag, the Brightest Cluster Galaxy (BCG) in their
trajectories. Here we present a strong lensing analysis of multiple image
systems identified on $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope}$ images. In particular,
we focus on the distribution of mass in Abell 2146-A in order to determine the
centroid of the dark matter halo. We use object colours and morphologies to
identify multiple image systems; very conservatively, four of these systems are
used as constraints on a lens mass model. We find that the centroid of the dark
matter halo, constrained using the strongly lensed features, is coincident with
the BCG, with an offset of $\approx$ 2 kpc between the centres of the dark
matter halo and the BCG. Thus from the strong lensing model, the X-ray cool
core also leads the centroid of the dark matter in Abell 2146-A, with an offset
of $\approx$ 30 kpc.
