In modern power systems, the operating point, at which the demand and supply
are balanced, continuously changes in an unpredictable way due to market
clearing, volatile loads, and intermittent renewable generations. Understanding
power systems dynamics in the presence of variation of equilibrium point (EP)
would be essential to the reliable operation of power systems. In this letter,
we formulate, for the first time, the inverse stability problem of power
systems, which concerns with characterizing the region of equilibrium points
(EPs) that the system can reach from a given initial state. The inverse
stability is rarely addressed in control systems theory, and thus, poorly
understood. Exploiting the quadratic bound of the energy function, we introduce
an estimate for the EP region of a given initial state. Also, we briefly
describe three possible applications of this inverse stability certificate,
which are immensely important to the integration of renewable generations: (i)
robust stability assessment of power systems with respect to intermittent
renewable generations, (ii) stability-constrained optimal power flow (sOPF),
and (iii) stability-guaranteed corrective actions.
