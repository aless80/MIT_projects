We have previously introduced role logic as a notation for describing
properties of relational structures in shape analysis, databases and knowledge
bases. A natural fragment of role logic corresponds to two-variable logic with
counting and is therefore decidable. We show how to use role logic to describe
open and closed records, as well the dual of records, inverse records. We
observe that the spatial conjunction operation of separation logic naturally
models record concatenation. Moreover, we show how to eliminate the spatial
conjunction of formulas of quantifier depth one in first-order logic with
counting. As a result, allowing spatial conjunction of formulas of quantifier
depth one preserves the decidability of two-variable logic with counting. This
result applies to two-variable role logic fragment as well. The resulting logic
smoothly integrates type system and predicate calculus notation and can be
viewed as a natural generalization of the notation for constraints arising in
role analysis and similar shape analysis approaches.
