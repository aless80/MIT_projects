A single-term density functional model for nondynamic and strong correlation
is presented, based on single-determinant Kohn-Sham density functional theory.
It is derived from modeling the adiabatic connection and contains only two
nonlinear empirical parameters. Preliminary tests show that the model recovers
majority of nondynamic correlation during a molecular dissociation and at the
same time performs reasonably for atomization energies. It demonstrates the
feasibility of developing DFT functionals for nondynamic and strong correlation
within the single-determinant KS scheme.
