An atomic ion is trapped at the tip of a single-mode optical fiber in a
cryogenic (8 K) surface-electrode ion trap. The fiber serves as an integrated
source of laser light, which drives the quadrupole qubit transition of
$^{88}$Sr$^+$. Through \emph{in situ} translation of the nodal point of the
trapping field, the Gaussian beam profile of the fiber output is imaged, and
the fiber-ion displacement, in units of the mode waist at the ion, is optimized
to within $0.13\pm0.10$ of the mode center despite an initial offset of
$3.30\pm0.10$. Fiber-induced charging at $125 \mu$W is observed to be
${\sim}10$ V/m at an ion height of $670 \mu$m, with charging and discharging
time constants of $1.6\pm0.3$ s and $4.7\pm0.6$ s respectively. This work is of
importance to large-scale, ion-based quantum information processing, where
optics integration in surface-electrode designs may be a crucial enabling
technology.
