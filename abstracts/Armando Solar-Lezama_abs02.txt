Syntax-Guided Synthesis (SyGuS) is the computational problem of finding an
implementation f that meets both a semantic constraint given by a logical
formula $\varphi$ in a background theory T, and a syntactic constraint given by
a grammar G, which specifies the allowed set of candidate implementations. Such
a synthesis problem can be formally defined in SyGuS-IF, a language that is
built on top of SMT-LIB.
The Syntax-Guided Synthesis Competition (SyGuS-Comp) is an effort to
facilitate, bring together and accelerate research and development of efficient
solvers for SyGuS by providing a platform for evaluating different synthesis
techniques on a comprehensive set of benchmarks. In this year's competition we
added a new track devoted to programming by examples. This track consisted of
two categories, one using the theory of bit-vectors and one using the theory of
strings. This paper presents and analyses the results of SyGuS-Comp'16.
