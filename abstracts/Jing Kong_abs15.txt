2D nanoelectronics based on single-layer MoS2 offers great advantages for
both conventional and ubiquitous applications. This paper discusses the
large-scale CVD growth of single-layer MoS2 and fabrication of devices and
circuits for the first time. Both digital and analog circuits are fabricated to
demonstrate its capability for mixed-signal applications.
