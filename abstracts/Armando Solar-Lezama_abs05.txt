This paper addresses the problem of creating simplifiers for logic formulas
based on conditional term rewriting. In particular, the paper focuses on a
program synthesis application where formula simplifications have been shown to
have a significant impact. We show that by combining machine learning
techniques with constraint-based synthesis, it is possible to synthesize a
formula simplifier fully automatically from a corpus of representative
problems, making it possible to create formula simplifiers tailored to specific
problem domains. We demonstrate the benefits of our approach for synthesis
benchmarks from the SyGuS competition and automated grading.
