We propose a new method for simplifying semidefinite programs (SDP) inspired
by symmetry reduction. Specifically, we show if an orthogonal projection
satisfies certain invariance conditions, restricting to its range yields an
equivalent primal-dual pair over a lower-dimensional symmetric cone---namely,
the cone-of-squares of a Jordan subalgebra of symmetric matrices. We then give
a simple algorithm for minimizing the rank of this projection and hence the
dimension of this cone. Through the theory of Jordan algebras, the proposed
method easily extends to linear programming, second-order cone programming,
and, more generally, symmetric cone optimization.
