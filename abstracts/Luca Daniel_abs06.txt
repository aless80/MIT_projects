This brief paper proposes an uncertainty quantification method for the
periodic steady-state (PSS) analysis with both Gaussian and non-Gaussian
variations. Our stochastic testing formulation for the PSS problem provides
superior efficiency over both Monte Carlo methods and existing spectral
methods. The numerical implementation of a stochastic shooting Newton solver is
presented for both forced and autonomous circuits. Simulation results on some
analog/RF circuits are reported to show the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithms.
