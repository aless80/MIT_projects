Bayesian hierarchical models are increasing popular in economics. When using
hierarchical models, it is useful not only to calculate posterior expectations,
but also to measure the robustness of these expectations to reasonable
alternative prior choices. We use variational Bayes and linear response methods
to provide fast, accurate posterior means and robustness measures with an
application to measuring the effectiveness of microcredit in the developing
world.
