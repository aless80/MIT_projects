We firstly translate the algebraic presentation of singular curves in [Se,
Chapter IV] into the analytic setting. Secondly, we present the concept of
Baker-Akhiezer functions [Kr] on such curves.Generalised divisors [Ha] and
their interplay with partial desingularisations are the fundament of their
construction.
