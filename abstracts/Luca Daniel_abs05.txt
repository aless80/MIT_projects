Stochastic spectral methods are efficient techniques for uncertainty
quantification. Recently they have shown excellent performance in the
statistical analysis of integrated circuits. In stochastic spectral methods,
one needs to determine a set of orthonormal polynomials and a proper numerical
quadrature rule. The former are used as the basis functions in a generalized
polynomial chaos expansion. The latter is used to compute the integrals
involved in stochastic spectral methods. Obtaining such information requires
knowing the density function of the random input {\it a-priori}. However,
individual system components are often described by surrogate models rather
than density functions. In order to apply stochastic spectral methods in
hierarchical uncertainty quantification, we first propose to construct
physically consistent closed-form density functions by two monotone
interpolation schemes. Then, by exploiting the special forms of the obtained
density functions, we determine the generalized polynomial-chaos basis
functions and the Gauss quadrature rules that are required by a stochastic
spectral simulator. The effectiveness of our proposed algorithm is verified by
both synthetic and practical circuit examples.
