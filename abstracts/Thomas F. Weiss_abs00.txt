This book presents a detailed study of a system of interacting Brownian
motions in one dimension. The interaction is point-like such that the $n$-th
Brownian motion is reflected from the Brownian motion with label $n-1$. This
model belongs to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In fact,
because of the singular interaction, many universal properties can be
established with rigor. They depend on the choice of initial conditions.
Discussion addresses packed and periodic initial conditions, stationary initial
conditions, and mixtures thereof. The suitably scaled spatial process will be
proven to converge to an Airy process in the long time limit. A chapter on
determinantal random fields and another one on Airy processes are added to have
the notes self-contained. This book serves as an introduction to the KPZ
universality class, illustrating the main concepts by means of a single model
only. It will be of interest to readers from interacting diffusion processes
and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics.
