An asymptotic theory is developed for computing volumes of regions in the
parameter space of a directed Gaussian graphical model that are obtained by
bounding partial correlations. We study these volumes using the method of real
log canonical thresholds from algebraic geometry. Our analysis involves the
computation of the singular loci of correlation hypersurfaces. Statistical
applications include the strong-faithfulness assumption for the PC-algorithm,
and the quantification of confounder bias in causal inference. A detailed
analysis is presented for trees, bow-ties, tripartite graphs, and complete
graphs.
