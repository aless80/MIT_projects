In this paper, we propose a novel method to estimate and characterize spatial
variations on dies or wafers. This new technique exploits recent developments
in matrix completion, enabling estimation of spatial variation across wafers or
dies with a small number of randomly picked sampling points while still
achieving fairly high accuracy. This new approach can be easily generalized,
including for estimation of mixed spatial and structure or device type
information.
