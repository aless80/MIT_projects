We study coloring problems, which are induced subposets P of a Boolean
lattice, paired with an order ideal I from the poset of intervals, ordered by
inclusion. We study a quasisymmetric function associated to coloring problems,
called the chromatic quasisymmetric function, generalizing Stanley's chromatic
symmetric function of a graph. We show that the chromatic quasisymmetric
function is an Ehrhart quasisymmetric function, and that a transformation of
the chromatic quasisymmetric function gives a Hilbert polynomial. Finally, we
introduce combinatorial Hopf monoids in pointed set species, and show that
coloring problems form the terminal object in the category of combinatorial
Hopf monoids.
