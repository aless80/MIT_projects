Python implementation of a case study in Module 1 in MITProfessionalX's course "Data Science: Data to insights". 

The case study is: "Module 1 - Making sense of unstructured data  Case Study". Case study is about doing our own analysis on MIT EECS

## Run the script
Clone the master branch and run it with e.g.:

`python scrape.py`

## Work in progress!

The script does the scraping and stores the abstract links for each faculty member in the MIT EECS faculty in the abs_dict dictionary.
